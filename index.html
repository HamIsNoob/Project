					<h2>What you can expect from our programs</h2>
					<p>The focus of “Think Global” is to offer a once<br>
					in a lifetime opportunity to New Zealand students<br>
					to travel across the global and experience what<br>
					other unique countries have to offer. Think Global<br>
					would offer exchange programs for university students<br>
					to travel to less developed countries to learn about<br>
					their culture, religion and way of living. This would<br>
					reflect Think Global’s vision of respect, acceptance<br>
					and appreciation as it would give students a hands-on<br>
					first-person perspective of how different countries run.</p>
